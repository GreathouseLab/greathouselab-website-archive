      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in joining the lab we are always looking for self-motivated, dedicated, and jovial individuals. 
We like to train and mentor young scientists at all levels, undergrad, graduate, and postdoctoral. 
If you are interested in our masters program in nutrition or our joint PhD program with Health, Human Performance and Recreation, please apply through our graduate program &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baylor.edu/graduate/index.php?id=958628&#34;&gt;https://www.baylor.edu/graduate/index.php?id=958628&lt;/a&gt;. 
We also take rotation students through the Biology PhD program.
We are always happy to talk about our research and how you might fit into our group.&lt;/p&gt;
